			</p>
			<p>
				We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use, or navigate the

					<em>Log and Usage Data.</em>
					Log and usage data is service-related, diagnostic, usage, and performance
					information our servers automatically collect when you access or use our
					Services and which we record in log files. Depending on how you interact with
					us, this log data may include your IP address, device information, browser type,

					date/time stamps associated with your usage, pages and files viewed, searches,
					and other actions you take such as which features you use), device event

				<li data-custom-class="body_text" style="line-height: 1.5">
					<em>Device Data.</em>
					We collect device data such as information about your computer, phone, tablet,

					system, and system configuration information.
				</li>
				<li data-custom-class="body_text" style="line-height: 1.5">
					<em>Location Data.</em>
					We collect location data such as information about your device's location, which
					can be either precise or imprecise. How much information we collect depends on
					the type and settings of the device you use to access the Services. For example,
					we may use GPS and other technologies to collect geolocation data that tells us
					your current location (based on your IP address). You can opt out of allowing us
					to collect this information either by refusing access to the information or by
					disabling your Location setting on your device. However, if you choose to opt
					out, you may not be able to use certain aspects of the Services.
