		<p><strong>This is a work in progress</strong></p>
		<p>
			This economy price guide is based off of Naughty_UK's super useful
			<a href="https://www.naughtynathan.co.uk/minecraft/prices.htm" target="_blank"
				>octain economy price guide</a
			>. Kinda stealing the table layout as well because I always thought it was well laid
			out.
		</p>
		<p>
			Apart from this price guide being generally modernised and updated to include all
			(eventually) 1.16 blocks and items, a major difference is that I'm working off unit
			prices, <strong>NOT</strong> stack prices.
