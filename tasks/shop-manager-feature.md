# Shop Manager Feature - VZ Price Guide

## Overview

Build a comprehensive Shop Manager feature to track multiple Minecraft server shops with buy/sell prices. This feature will enable users to manage their own shops and compare prices across different servers and competitors.

## Inspiration

Based on Excel spreadsheet showing shops like "verzion", "adamantine", "PizzaKing446", etc. with item pricing comparisons.

## Architecture

### Data Structure Hierarchy

```
Servers Collection (âœ… IMPLEMENTED)
â”œâ”€â”€ name (e.g., "Hypixel Skyblock")
â”œâ”€â”€ minecraft_version (e.g., "1.20")
â”œâ”€â”€ owner_id (user reference)
â”œâ”€â”€ description
â”œâ”€â”€ created_at
â””â”€â”€ updated_at

Shops Collection (ðŸ”„ PENDING)
â”œâ”€â”€ name (e.g., "verzion's shop")
â”œâ”€â”€ server_id (server reference)
â”œâ”€â”€ owner_id (user reference)
â”œâ”€â”€ is_own_shop (boolean)
â”œâ”€â”€ location (optional)
â”œâ”€â”€ description
â”œâ”€â”€ created_at
â””â”€â”€ updated_at

Shop_Items Collection (âœ… IMPLEMENTED)
â”œâ”€â”€ shop_id (shop reference)
â”œâ”€â”€ item_id (reference to items collection)
â”œâ”€â”€ buy_price (nullable)
â”œâ”€â”€ sell_price (nullable)
â”œâ”€â”€ previous_buy_price (nullable)
â”œâ”€â”€ previous_sell_price (nullable)
â”œâ”€â”€ previous_price_date (nullable)
â”œâ”€â”€ stock_quantity (optional)
â”œâ”€â”€ stock_full (boolean, default: false)
â”œâ”€â”€ last_updated
â””â”€â”€ notes
```

### Simple Price History Logic

When updating prices in the `shopItems.js` utility:

1. **Before updating**: Save current `buy_price` â†’ `previous_buy_price`, `sell_price` â†’ `previous_sell_price`
2. **Store timing**: Save current `last_updated` â†’ `previous_price_date`
3. **Update current**: Set new prices and `last_updated`

This approach provides:

-   **Current prices** for active trading
-   **Previous prices** to show price trends (â†‘ â†“)
-   **Change timing** to track when prices last changed
-   **Simple implementation** without complex price history tables

### Stock Management

The `stock_full` boolean field handles a common Minecraft shop scenario:

-   When set to `true`, indicates the shop's chest is full and cannot accept more items
-   Useful for buy prices - shop owner can't purchase more items until chest is emptied
-   Helps with shop status tracking and price comparison accuracy
-   Defaults to `false` for normal trading operations

### Key Features

#### 1. Multi-Server Support

-   Track shops across different Minecraft servers
-   Filter items by server's Minecraft version
-   Server-specific item availability

#### 2. Shop Management

-   Create and manage own shops
-   Track competitor shops
-   Categorize shops by type (buy/sell/both)

#### 3. Price Comparison

-   Compare prices across shops
-   Market analysis views
-   Price history tracking

#### 4. Version-Aware Items

-   Filter items based on server Minecraft version
-   Use existing items collection with version field
-   Respect resource files for version-specific items
