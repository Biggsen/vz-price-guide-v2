# Shop Manager Feature - VZ Price Guide

## Overview

Build a comprehensive Shop Manager feature to track multiple Minecraft server shops with buy/sell prices. This feature will enable users to manage their own shops and compare prices across different servers and competitors.

## Inspiration

Based on Excel spreadsheet showing shops like "verzion", "adamantine", "PizzaKing446", etc. with item pricing comparisons.

## Technical Considerations

### Database Relationships

### Security Rules

-   Users can only manage their own servers/shops
-   Price comparison requires read access to public shops
-   Admin users can manage all data

### UI/UX Considerations

-   Mobile-responsive design
-   Intuitive navigation between servers/shops
-   Clear visual hierarchy for price comparisons
-   Bulk operations for efficiency

## Success Metrics

-   Users can create and manage multiple servers

-   System handles large amounts of pricing data efficiently

## Future Enhancements

-   Real-time price updates
-   Price alerts and notifications
