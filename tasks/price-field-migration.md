# Price Field Migration Tasks

## Overview

Migrate from the legacy `price` field to the unified `prices_by_version` structure with static and dynamic pricing. This migration will consolidate pricing logic and eliminate the dual-field approach currently used as a fallback mechanism.

## Background

Currently, the system uses a hybrid approach:

-   **Legacy `price` field**: Used as fallback and for simple operations
-   **`prices_by_version` structure**: Used for version-aware pricing with static/dynamic types
-   **`getEffectivePrice()` function**: Handles fallback logic from `prices_by_version` to `price`

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Preparation & Data Audit ‚è≥

#### Task 1.1: Comprehensive Data Audit

-   [ ] **Create audit script** to analyze current pricing data
    -   [ ] Count items with only `price` field
    -   [ ] Count items with only `prices_by_version` field
    -   [ ] Count items with both fields
    -   [ ] Identify pricing inconsistencies between fields
    -   [ ] Generate audit report with statistics

#### Task 1.2: Version Data Validation

-   [ ] **Audit version field completeness**
    -   [ ] Identify items missing `version` field
    -   [ ] Identify items missing `version_removed` field
    -   [ ] Map version availability per item
    -   [ ] Flag items with invalid version ranges

#### Task 1.3: Pricing Type Classification

-   [ ] **Classify existing items by pricing type**
    -   [ ] Items with recipes ‚Üí `dynamic` candidates
    -   [ ] Items without recipes ‚Üí `static` pricing
    -   [ ] Generate pricing type recommendations
    -   [ ] Validate against existing `pricing_type` field

#### Task 1.4: Create Migration Script

## Risk Mitigation

### Data Loss Prevention

-   **Backup Strategy**: Full database backup before migration
-   **Rollback Plan**: Ability to restore `price` field from backup
-   **Validation**: Comprehensive pre/post migration validation
-   **Gradual Migration**: Phase-by-phase approach with validation

### Performance Risks

-   **Query Optimization**: Test query performance before production
-   **Caching Strategy**: Implement caching for frequently accessed pricing
-   **Index Strategy**: Optimize Firestore indexes for new query patterns
-   **Load Testing**: Validate performance under production load

### Functionality Risks

-   **Feature Regression**: Comprehensive testing of all pricing-related features
-   **User Experience**: Ensure UI remains intuitive during transition
-   **Third-party Integration**: Validate any external integrations still work
-   **Edge Cases**: Test unusual pricing scenarios and data conditions

## Success Criteria

-   [ ] **100% of items** have complete `prices_by_version` data
-   [ ] **All legacy `price` field** references removed from codebase
-   [ ] **No performance degradation** in pricing-related operations
-   [ ] **All tests passing** with new pricing architecture
-   [ ] **User workflows** remain functional and intuitive
-   [ ] **Admin tools** work with version-aware pricing
-   [ ] **Shop manager** maintains full functionality
-   [ ] **Database size** optimized (removal of redundant `price` field)

## Timeline Estimate

-   **Phase 1**: 1-2 weeks (Preparation & Data Audit)
-   **Phase 2**: 2-3 weeks (Backend Updates)
-   **Phase 3**: 2-3 weeks (Frontend Updates)
-   **Phase 4**: 1-2 weeks (Testing & Validation)
-   **Phase 5**: 1 week (Migration Execution)
-   **Phase 6**: 1 week (Post-Migration Optimization)

**Total Estimated Timeline**: 8-12 weeks

## Notes

-   This migration should be coordinated with the ongoing recipes feature development
-   Consider impact on any planned features that might depend on pricing
-   Ensure adequate testing time, especially for shop manager integration
-   Plan for potential rollback if issues are discovered post-migration
-   Document any breaking changes for API consumers
