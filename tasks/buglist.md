### Enchantment Books Not Separated When Adding Crate Items

**Status**: ðŸ”´ Active  
**Priority**: High  
**Type**: Regression  
**Discovered**: 2025-10-12

**Description**:
When adding items for a crate, enchanted books are not being added as separate book and enchantment entities. The system should split enchanted books into their base book item and the enchantment as separate entries, but this functionality is broken.

**Expected Behavior**:

-   Enchanted book should be split into:
    1. Book item entry
    2. Enchantment entry with appropriate level

**Actual Behavior**:

-   Enchanted books are being added as a single item without separation

**Impact**:

-   Affects crate reward pricing accuracy
-   Breaks enchantment book pricing workflow
-   Users cannot properly value enchanted books in crates

**Files Potentially Affected**:

-   `src/utils/crateRewards.js`
-   `src/views/CrateSingleView.vue`
-   Related item/enchantment handling utilities

**Notes**:

-   This was working previously, indicating a regression
-   May be related to recent changes in crate management workflow
