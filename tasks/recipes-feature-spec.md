# üßæ Minecraft Price Guide: Recipe Feature Specification

## üìå Overview

This system supports a version-aware, partially dynamic price guide for Minecraft items. Each item can have manually set prices (static) or calculated prices based on crafting recipes (dynamic). Recipes and prices can vary between versions, but most will inherit from earlier versions unless overridden. Base prices are curated and rarely change; derived prices are only recalculated when manually triggered.

**Status**: ‚úÖ **PRODUCTION READY** - Complete implementation with all UX issues resolved

## 1. üß± Item Data Structure

```ts
Item {
  name: string;
  material_id: string;
  image: string;
  url?: string;
  stack: number;
  category: string;
  subcategory?: string;
  version: string;
  version_removed: string | null;
  pricing_type: 'static' | 'dynamic';
  prices_by_version: {
    [version: string]: number;
  };
  recipes_by_version?: {
    [version: string]: Recipe;
  };
}

Recipe {
  ingredients: Array<{
    material_id: string;
    quantity: number;
  }>;
  output_count: number;
}
```

**Note**: Recipe format stores only the essential data needed for price calculations (ingredients and output count).

---

## 2. üí∞ Pricing System

-   **All prices are cached** in `prices_by_version`
-   `static`: fixed and manually edited
-   `dynamic`: calculated from recipes, but not auto-updated
-   Manual admin actions trigger recalculation for a version
-   **Version inheritance**: If a recipe is missing for a version, fallback to the latest earlier version
-   **Circular dependency detection**: Prevents infinite loops in price calculations
-   **Rounding**: Dynamic prices are always rounded up to whole numbers

### ‚úÖ Implemented Features:

-   Version-aware price inheritance with fallback logic
-   Circular dependency detection and prevention
-   Comprehensive price calculation chain logging
-   Batch price recalculation with detailed results
-   Automatic pricing type detection based on recipe availability

---

## 3. üîÅ Reverse Index

**Status**: Not yet implemented (optional optimization)

-   Maps materials to the items that use them per version
-   Used for efficient recalculation of affected items when a base price changes

```ts
reverseIndex: {
  "iron_ingot": {
    "1.16": ["iron_pickaxe", "anvil"],
    "1.18": ["iron_pickaxe", "minecart"]
  }
}
```

## 5. üß† Recipe Inheritance

**Status**: ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED**

-   Only define a recipe for the version where it changes
-   Use the nearest earlier version for fallback during price calculations
-   Recipe management page shows inherited vs explicit recipes
-   Can override inherited recipes by creating version-specific recipe
-   **Automatic Fallback**: `getEffectivePrice()` handles version inheritance seamlessly

| ID not found          | Show warning, suggest similar materials                 | ‚úÖ     |
| Null/empty shape cell | Skip cell, continue processing                          | ‚úÖ     |
| Invalid recipe data   | Show error, allow manual correction                     | ‚úÖ     |
