## Bugs / Issues

-   In the shop page, adding notes using the inline editing is buggy. Doesn't save always and just results in a long dash.

## Enhancements / Ideas

-   Require server version selector to support minor versions (e.g., 1.21.4 instead of only 1.21).
-   The server cards aren't working so well for managing a lot of shops. It gets very long and there's little space to have sorting and such. Considering that a table might be better.
-   Inline price editing on the market overview would be great.
-   Being able to add multiple items at once would be great. It could be a checkbox in the item selector and you can check many items. They'd all share the same other values (buy, sell, notes).
